    1.Wash up. Bathe in warm—not hot—water; use mild cleansers that don’t irritate; and wash gently—don’t scrub.
<Br>
    2.Block sun damage. Avoid intense sun exposure, use sunscreen, and wear protective clothing.
<Br>
    3.Don’t use tanning beds or sunlamps. They emit the same harmful UV radiation as the sun.
<Br>
    4.Avoid dry skin. Drink plenty of water, and use gentle moisturizers, lotions, or creams.
<Br>
    5.Reduce stress. Stress can harm your skin and other body systems.
<Br>
    6.Get enough sleep. Experts recommend about 9 hours a night for teens and 7-8 hours for adults.
<Br>
    7.Speak up. Talk to your doctor if you notice any odd changes to your skin, like a rash or mole that changes size or color.
<Br>
    8.Use a safe, mineral-based sunscreen daily.
<Br>
    9.Take care of your gut. Research shows that underlying gut health issues can manifest on the skin in many ways, from acne to eczema.
